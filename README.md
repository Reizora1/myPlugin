# MyPlugin
- This repository contains the source code of myPlugin, which contains various spigot APIs for certain actions/events of a player in a minecraft server.
- This is an experimental project that I made as I am still learning more about minecraft plugin development.
- It is lacking in many aspects that I may not know yet but I am gonna constantly push new updates of things that can be implemented.
- Feel free to leave me a comment in the Discussions tab for feedback and insights.
