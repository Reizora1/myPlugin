I modified this textfile's content from the editbranch and is to be passed into the master branch.
If you are reading this from the master, it means i succesfully made a commit to my local branch and pushed it to the remote branch then I requested a pull request from the editbranch to the master branch--
and made a git pull origin editbranch from the master branch.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Now this section of text was modified from the local editbranch and pushed to the remote editbranch but will not be passed to the local and remote master branches.
=======
