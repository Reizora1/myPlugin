I modified this textfile's content from the editbranch and is to be passed into the master branch.
If you are reading this from the master, it means i succesfully made a commit to my local branch and pushed it to the remote branch then I requested a pull request from the editbranch to the master branch--
and made a git pull origin editbranch from the master branch.
